## Overview

I tried to recreate the QR Code challenge to be as close to the challenge image as possible. Although I struggled a little bit with the media query, I finally got it to work(at a min-width that works for my screen size)

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
  -Media Queries(Built as mobile version then added a media query for the desktop version)

### Continued development

I need to continue improving and learning to build a more responsive layout. No static values but more of %s, rems and ems for a website that can be used on various devices.
I need to better understand page layouts and the z-index properties and when it is required to use a DIV. Also need to get used to using semantic HTML properly.
